# Machine Learning for beginners

In this repository, you can find introductory level machine learning application notebooks created by the Northumbria University - Institute of Coding team. You can clone this repository to your own computer, or you can press the "**Open in Colab**" buttons below to use Google's interactive notebook runtime environment. 

## Face Recognition application

In this example, we will approach face recognition problem as a classification problem. We will train support vector machines-based (SVM) classifier using scikit-learn library and a simple Convolutional Neural Network for a  face recognition application.
