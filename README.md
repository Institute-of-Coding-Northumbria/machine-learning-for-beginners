# Machine Learning for Beginners

In this repository, you can find introductory level machine learning application notebooks created by the Northumbria University Institute of Coding team. You can download clone this repository to your own computer and open it in your own Jupypter Notebook environment, or you can press the "**Open in Colab**" buttons below to use Google's interactive notebook runtime environment. 

### Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook allows you to open documents that contain instructional material and programming language code. To run Jupyter Notebook on your own computer you will need to [install it first](https://jupyter.org/install.html).

## Face Recognition application

In this example, we will approach face recognition problem as a classification problem. We will train support vector machines-based (SVM) classifier using scikit-learn library and a simple Convolutional Neural Network for a  face recognition application.
